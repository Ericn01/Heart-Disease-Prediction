    "## Context\n",
    "In Notebook 1, we identified that **67.4%** of cases were incomplete (missing at least one value) across *potentially* important variables, with patterns strongly suggesting population-level differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before proceeding with modeling, we need to understand whether the four populations (Cleveland, Hungarian, Switzerland, VA Long Beach) can be reasonably pooled together or should be treated separately (or partially pooled).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "This notebook compares the four populations to:\n",
    "- Describe sample sizes and baseline characteristics.\n",
    "- Test whether populations differ materially on key variables.\n",
    "- Make a principled recommendation about pooling vs separate analysis.\n",
    "- Propose a missing-data handling strategy per variable (overall and by population).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Questions\n",
    "1. What are the sample sizes and characteristics of each population?\n",
    "2. How do missing data patterns differ across populations?\n",
    "3. Are the populations statistically comparable on key variables?\n",
    "4. Should we pool populations or analyze them separately?\n",
    "5. What is the appropriate strategy for handling missing data in each variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes / Assumptions\n",
    "- The four datasets represent different clinical sites and data collection protocols; we expect systematic differences.\n",
    "- Encodings follow the standard UCI Heart Disease documentation (we will flag out-of-domain values rather than auto-correct).\n",
    "- For comparability tests, we test distributions on observed values; missingness itself is analyzed separately.\n"
