    "# UCI Heart Disease Dataset: Predictive Modeling & Feature Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "Based on the exploratory analysis in Notebook 3, we identified [...]. This notebook develops predictive models to classify heart disease severity and, most importantly, identifies the most important factors driving these predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "Build a robust predictive model for heart disease severity and extract interpretable feature importance to answer: **What are the most important factors in determining heart disease severity?**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Questions\n",
    "1. Which modeling approach best predicts heart disease severity?\n",
    "2. What are the most important features for prediction?\n",
    "3. How do feature importance rankings align with medical knowledge?\n",
    "4. What is the model's performance and reliability?\n",
    "5. What are the clinical and practical implications of our findings?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook Outline\n",
