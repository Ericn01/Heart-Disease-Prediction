    "# UCI Heart Disease Dataset: Initial Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "The UCI Heart Disease database contains data from four locations: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and the VA Long Beach. It contains 76 attributes, though most published experiments use a subset of 14 features. The target variable represents the presence and severity of heart disease on a 0-4 scale, where 0 indicates no disease and 1-4 represent increasing severity levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "This notebook performs an initial exploration of the complete UCI Heart Disease dataset to understand its structure, quality, and characteristics before proceeding with detailed analysis and modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Questions\n",
    "1. What variables are available in the dataset and what do they represent?\n",
    "2. What is the distribution of heart disease severity across all samples?\n",
    "3. What is the extent and pattern of missing data?\n",
    "4. Are there any immediate data quality issues that need to be addressed?\n",
    "5. Do missing data patterns suggest the need for population-specific analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook Outline\n",
    "1. Data Loading & Basic Overview\n",
    "2. Variable Description & Data Dictionary\n",
    "3. Target Variable Analysis\n",
    "4. Missing Data Analysis\n",
    "5. Initial Observations & Next Steps"
