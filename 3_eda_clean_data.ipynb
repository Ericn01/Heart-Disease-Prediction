    "# UCI Heart Disease Dataset: Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "Following the population analysis and data cleaning in Notebook 2, we now have a prepared dataset ready for in-depth exploratory analysis. [*Decision for how to proceed with the analysis will be written here*].\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "This notebook explores relationships between features and heart disease severity to understand which factors are most associated with cardiovascular disease and generate hypotheses for predictive modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Questions\n",
    "1. Which individual features show the strongest relationships with heart disease severity?\n",
    "2. Are there non-linear relationships that need to be captured?\n",
    "3. What interactions exist between predictor variables?\n",
    "4. Do any features require transformation for modeling?\n",
    "5. What patterns emerge that align with or challenge medical knowledge?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook Outline\n",
    "1. Data Loading & Verification\n",
    "2. Univariate Analysis\n",
    "3. Bivariate Analysis (Features vs. Target)\n",
    "4. Multivariate Analysis & Correlations\n",
    "5. Feature Engineering Opportunities\n",
    "6. Summary of Insights for Modeling"
